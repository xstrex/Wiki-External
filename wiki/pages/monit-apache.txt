====== Monit Apache Config ======

Hint: It is recommended to use a "token" file (an empty file) for monit to request. That way, it is easy to filter out all the requests made by monit in the httpd access log file. Here's a trick shared by Marco Ermini: place the following in httpd.conf to stop apache from logging any requests done by monit:
<code>
  SetEnvIf        Request_URI "^\/monit\/token$" dontlog
  CustomLog       logs/access.log common env=!dontlog
</code>
In some cases init scripts for apache and apache-ssl are separated, e.g. Debian Linux.
<code>
 check process apache with pidfile /opt/apache_misc/logs/httpd.pid
   group www
   start program = "/etc/init.d/apache start"
   stop  program = "/etc/init.d/apache stop"
   if failed host localhost port 80 
        protocol HTTP request "/~hauk/monit/token" then restart
   if failed host 192.168.1.1 port 443 type TCPSSL 
        certmd5 12-34-56-78-90-AB-CD-EF-12-34-56-78-90-AB-CD-EF
	protocol HTTP request http://localhost/~hauk/monit/token  then restart
   depends on apache_bin
   depends on apache_rc

 check file apache_bin with path /opt/apache/bin/httpd
   group www
   if failed checksum then unmonitor
   if failed permission 755 then unmonitor
   if failed uid root then unmonitor
   if failed gid root then unmonitor

 check file apache_rc with path /etc/init.d/apache
   group www
   if failed checksum then unmonitor
   if failed permission 755 then unmonitor
   if failed uid root then unmonitor
   if failed gid root then unmonitor
