====== Hiking Gear ======

I use Lighterpack.com to keep track of all my gear and weights, I find it especially useful when packing up for a trip. Here's a few of my current gear list:

====== Trip Reports ======

This section is a work in progress, I hope to develop a form method in which I can upload a gpx file for download, as well as render a map and elevation plot of the trip, as well as a report. More to come.
