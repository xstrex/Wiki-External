====== Harmony House Recipes ======
Below is a collection of Harmony House recipes I've created. Each listing makes 1 serving and needs about 2 Cups of boiling water, and roughly 20mins to re-hydrate. I'll just prepare the servings ahead of time, and put all the ingredients into a sandwich (or quart) sized ziploc bag, to take with me on the trail. 

__A few notes:__ HH = Harmony House, Links to other ingredients provided, otherwise use whatever brand you have, but follow the portions. For spices, I prefer [[https://www.penzeys.com/|Penzey's]]. All of these recipes are also gluten-free, if you don't have a gluten allergy, other ingredients can be substituted.
