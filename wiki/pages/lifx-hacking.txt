====== Lifx Smart Bulbs ======
There are plenty of reviews of the Lifx bulbs all around the internet. Just do a quick search and you'll find plenty of information about them. For me, what it boils down to is lumens and lifespan. If I buy a Smart bulb, it better be really good at producing lots of light, as well as last a really long time. [[http://comparesmartbulbs.com/|Here]] is a great head to head comparison of all the bulbs out there. If you ask me, Lifx is the clear winner. 

So you bought a fancy new Lifx bulb, configured it via the app and it's working great! But what if you don't want to be like so many americans and constantly be on your phone? Or what if you come home, groceries in hand and really don't want to bother with pulling your phone out, just to turn on the light? This might sound simple enough, but when you're in that situation it's really quite annoying! 

Sure, Lifx offers some great features in their app that let you create a schedule for your bulbs, or use your Amazon Echo to turn them on or off. Yes Lifx offers geofencing, and integrates with apps like [[https://ifttt.com/recipes|IFTTT]] to help with this, but those all require GPS on your phone, which will use precious battery power. If you're anything like me, and don't really want to mess with an app, or anything for that matter, how do you get this fancy new automation? The answer is OpenHAB. 

===== Lifx and OpenHAB =====
If you're using OpenHAB version 2.x they have integrated a native Lifx binding, which can be found [[http://docs.openhab.org/features/bindings/lifx/readme.html|here]], and it works great! 

If you're like me, and you're still using the 1.x branch then you'll need to find another way to integrate the bulbs. 

Unfortunately v1 of the Lifx API requires an internet connection, but this should be changing in the near future. 

First thing's first, head over to Lifx's web [[https://api.developer.lifx.com/|API]] and create yourself an account. Then using that account, get yourself an API key, which is documented [[https://community.lifx.com/t/creating-a-lifx-http-api-token/25|here]]. Make note of that key, you'll need it later. 

Head back over the API, and select the [[https://api.developer.lifx.com/docs/list-lights|List Lights]] option on the left. Add your key to the little "key" icon near the bottom, and in the selector field put the word "all" and click "Try It!". This will return the JSON values for all of the lights connected to your account. 

The 2 critical pieces of information here, is the ID number associated with your bulb, and your API key. 

Using these two together you can create a shell script that will toggle the bulb on/off, set the brightness, or even color. The API documentation is fairly good at explaining everything, but here's an example of a simple script I use to turn on one of my lights: <code>/usr/bin/curl -s -X PUT "https://api.lifx.com/v1/lights/XX7XXX01XX0X/state" -H "Authorization: Bearer c5xderf24dXXXXXX66524bXXx385eeXXXXXX56eaabd49bXXXXX7d1e60c3xxx9" -F "power=on" >> /dev/null</code>

Then I can add this script to my OpenHAB items file: <code>Switch LifxLR            "Living Room"          <light>         (MyOpenHAB, Lighting, Living_Room_Lighting)     { exec="ON:/etc/openhab/scripts/LifxLROn.sh, OFF:/etc/openhab/scripts/LifxLROff.sh"}</code>
And my OpenHAB sitemap: <code>Switch item=LifxLR</code>
